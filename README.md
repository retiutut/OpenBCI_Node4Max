# OpenBCI_Node4Max
The purpose of this repo is to integrate Ganglion or Cyton directly in Max 8 using Node for Max. Filtering and processing algorithms will be added soon. This project uses the [OpenBCI GUI](https://github.com/OpenBCI/OpenBCI_GUI) as an example. 

Ideal Data Flow:

Acquire Raw Data from Board -> Signal Processing -> Display Data or Output to Machine Learning.

# To Do:
- Basic Filtering
- Display Time Series
- Calculate Band Power
